Lighting modules will consist of a controller running MS sensor node network and various control methods. 

Options for PHYSICAL light control are:
  HW based PWM+ high power MOSFET/FET
  Offboard PWM chips
    WS2811 (1-wire) (high and low power)
    APA101 (2-wire)
    TLC5940 (SPI, possible conflict with RF radio)
  Binary Switches with AC/DC relay
  
RGB plugin available for VERA control center, more appropriate controls may be implemented in android App.
